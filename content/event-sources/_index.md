title: "Event Sources for Rift"
weight: 11
---

Event sources are typically alerting platforms that send notifications to on-call engineers when an alert threshold is breached or an outage occurs.  Currently Rift supports the following as event sources:

- [PagerDuty](/event-sources/pagerduty)
- [Alert Manager](/event-sources/alertmanager)

**If you are using a different alerting platform, please do let us know which ones in this [github issue.](https://)**
